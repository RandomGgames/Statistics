# Statistics-Data-Pack
Creates a scoreboard for every statistic in the game.

# How to use
This pack only generates scoreboards for every statistic. A full list can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/RandomGgames/Statistics-Data-Pack/wiki).

Scoreboards can be displayed on the sidebar using the command `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar OBJECTIVE` or in the player list with `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay list OBJECTIVE`

Since there are so many scoreboard objectives, if you want to delete the pack AND reset/remove all the objectives it creates, use the built in `/function disable:statistics` command to disable the pack. This will delete all objectives and disable the pack in one command.
