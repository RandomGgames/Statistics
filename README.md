# Statistics-Data-Pack
Creates a scoreboard for every statistic in the game.

# How to Install
Download the data pack and either drag and drop into the data pack selection screen or drop into your save's datapacks folder than reload it.

# How to use
This pack only generates scoreboards for every statistic. A full list can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/RandomGgames/Statistics-Data-Pack/wiki).

Scoreboards can be displayed on the sidebar using the command `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar OBJECTIVE` or in the player list with `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay list OBJECTIVE`

Since there are so many scoreboard objectives, when removing the pack, run `/function disable:statistics` which will DELETE all the scoreboard objectives and automatically disable itself.
